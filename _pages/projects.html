	<b>Nefelibeta : Academic Resource and Information Platform for Fudan Students</b>
	<br>
	Final Project for <i>Innovative Experiment of Networks </i> 2019 Spring @ Fudan University, by <a href="https://Nefelly.github.io/">Xintao Wang</a> and Mingzhe Zhu.
	<br>
	I worked with Mingzhe Zhu to design a web platform for shared information about academic resources for Fudan students . I was responsible for front-end development and front-and-back interface, creating a delicate star-style web page with Javascript, Html, Django, Bootstrap , Ajax and Vue.</td>

	<b>Geo-fencing: An application of spatial indexing data structure</b>
	<br>
	Final Project for <i>Data Structure</i> 2018 Fall @ Fudan University, by <a href="https://Nefelly.github.io/">Xintao Wang</a>.
	<br>
	In this project, we are required to apply data structures to a practical scenario. Specifically, we are supposed to employ a spatial indexing data structure to solve the geo-fencing task, in which there are a great amount of insertion, deletion and query operations about the spatial relation between points and polygons.
	<br>
	Personally, I applied R-Tree as a spatial indexing data structure and ray casting to determine the relationship between dots and polygons.

	<b>Alice : A Servant Robot with Gesture Recognition</b>
	<br>
	Project for <i>Robotics and Artificial Intelligence</i> 2019 Summer@ Imperial College London, by <a href="https://Nefelly.github.io/">Xintao Wang</a>( Team Leader), Jianjian Huang, Zilin Liu, Yirui Liu, Junhu Fu, Gaozhi Liu and Kai Lyu.
	<br>
	In this project, we designed a robot which was able to recognize human gestures through Convolution Neural Networks as orders with a 3D camera and act correspondingly to bring convenience to our users. Virtual marketing strategies were also designed .

	<b>Natural Language Processing and Stock Price Predictition</b>
	<br>
	Final Project for <i>Natural Language Processing</i> 2019 Fall @ Fudan University, by <a href="https://Nefelly.github.io/">Xintao Wang</a>.
	<br>
	In this project, I made predictions about stock price with recent reddit news and historical data by CNN and LSTM, and analyzed textual features of days when stock price increased or decreased.

	<b>Fantasy and Adventure – A VR Scenery in Unity</b>
	<br>
	Final Project for <i>Introduction to Virtual Reality</i> 2019 Spring @ Fudan University, by <a href="https://Nefelly.github.io/">Xintao Wang</a>.
	<br>
	In this project, I made a game-style fantastic scenery with models of monsters such as dragon-head-style cannons, element creatures of ice and thunder, octopuses, a devil and a holy dear. Most models were made and painted on my own with blender and substance painter. Students were allowed a chance to ‘see’ and ‘feel’ the VR world they created.

	<br>
	In this project, we created a chatroom providing group chat and private chat functions. The communication protocol was made with socket library, and the GUI was created with PyQt.
